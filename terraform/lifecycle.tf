# B1 — The Glacier cost gotcha
#
# Sold listings' photos archive to Glacier 30 days after upload, to cut storage cost. Separately
# (not modeled in Terraform — it's an application-level flow), a seller can request deletion of
# their listing data, which must happen within 30 days of the request.
#
# Reason through: a photo archives to Glacier on day 30. The seller requests deletion on day 40.
# You delete it immediately. What does that actually cost, given Glacier's minimum storage
# duration, and what would you change here?
